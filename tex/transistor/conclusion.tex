\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


\coolName{} is a new stream cipher design tailored to TFHE
transciphering, that significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art of
TFHE-friendly stream ciphers.  After analyzing the constraints of the
TFHE setting in the context of a symmetric cipher, we designed
\coolName{} by combining an LFSR-based key schedule, an LFSR-based
whitening, and a non-linear FSM with an AES-like structure.  We report
implementation results of \coolName{} using state-of-the-art TFHE, using
a trick to implement \emph{silent} LFSRs.  This general structure can be
easily adapted to other contexts, and we believe it will find
applications beyond TFHE.

Our initial cryptanalysis of \coolName{} provides a solid
theoretical background for this type of stream ciphers.  We introduce
arguments based on the minimum number of rounds needed to have a
non-zero correlation between ciphertext and master key, an inherent
property of the round function of the FSM which we consider to be of
independent interest.  We expect that future work will explore in more
details how this property is related to the design of the round
function, and how to optimize it without increasing the cost of the
cipher.
