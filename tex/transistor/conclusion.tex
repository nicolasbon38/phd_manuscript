\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


\coolName{} is a new stream cipher design tailored to \gls{TFHE}
transciphering, that significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art of
\gls{TFHE}-friendly stream ciphers.  After analyzing the constraints of the
\gls{TFHE} setting in the context of a symmetric cipher, we designed
\coolName{} by combining an LFSR-based key schedule, an LFSR-based
whitening, and a non-linear FSM with an \gls{AES}-like structure.  We report
implementation results of \coolName{} using state-of-the-art \gls{TFHE}, using
a trick to implement \emph{silent} LFSRs.  This general structure can be
easily adapted to other contexts, and we believe it will find
applications beyond \gls{TFHE}.


One of the constraint of this design was that the cipher should work in a small plaintext space. This was because the bottleneck in terms of running time was the evaluation of the \gls{S-box}. But what if we could extend the capabilities of \gls{TFHE} and evaluates larger \gls{S-box}es, like in more conventional designs ?

This is the point of the next chapter, where we propose a construction to accelerate the evaluation of larger \gls{LUT}.
