\label{sec:bench}
\TODO{Laissable tel quel je pense, mais relire quand mÃªme}

This section focuses on the performances of transciphering with \coolName. We first address the wrapping of a (\coolName) symmetric key as a compact set of TFHE ciphertexts for which we additionally introduce a trade-off between bandwidth and computation. Next, we explain how to manage different data representations to be able to fit with the input format of the server application. We then provide a detailed description of the homomorphic evaluation of \coolName. We finally give some implementation benchmarks and comparison to the state of the art.

\subsection{Key Wrapping and Bandwidth in TFHE Transciphering} \label{sec:key_wrapping}

Assume one wants to generate a fresh TFHE ciphertext vector $(c_1, \ldots, c_t)$ for a plaintext vector $(m_1, \ldots, m_t) \in \mathbb{Z}_p^t$, where $c_i = (a_{i,1}, \ldots, a_{i,n}, b_i)$, for every $i \in [1,t]$. Since the $a_{i,j}$'s are uniformly sampled at random over $\mathbb{Z}_q$, a folklore trick is to generate them pseudorandomly from a seed. We get the following compressed encryption procedure (where $\lambda$ denotes the security level in bits):
\ifeprint
  
\begin{center}
\noindent\framebox{
\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
\underline{$\mathtt{CompressEncrypt}(s,m_1, \ldots, m_t)$}
	\vspace{-2mm}

	\item Sample $\mathsf{seed} \gets \{0,1\}^\lambda$
	\smallskip
	\item Expand $((a_{i,j})_{1 \leq j \leq n})_{1 \leq i \leq t} \gets \mathsf{PRG}(\mathsf{seed})$
	\smallskip
	\item $\forall \:i \in [1,t]$: $b_i \gets \sum_{j=1}^n a_{i,j} \cdot s_j + \tilde{m}_i + e_i$ with $e_i \gets \chi_{\sigma}$
	\smallskip
	\item Return $(\mathsf{seed}, b_1, \ldots, b_t)$
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}}
\end{center}

\smallskip
\else
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Sample $\mathsf{seed} \gets \{0,1\}^\lambda$
    \smallskip
  \item Expand $((a_{i,j})_{1 \leq j \leq n})_{1 \leq i \leq t} \gets \mathsf{PRG}(\mathsf{seed})$
    \smallskip
  \item $\forall \:i \in [1,t]$: $b_i \gets \sum_{j=1}^n a_{i,j} \cdot s_j + \tilde{m}_i + e_i$ with $e_i \gets \chi_{\sigma}$
    \smallskip
  \item Return $(\mathsf{seed}, b_1, \ldots, b_t)$
  \end{enumerate}
\fi

Recovering standard TFHE ciphertexts $c_1$, \ldots, $c_t$ from the compressed form $(\mathsf{seed}, b_1, \ldots, b_t)$ is simply done by expanding the $a_{i,j}$'s from $\mathsf{seed}$. The size of the obtained compressed ciphertext vector is $\lambda + t \cdot \log_2(q)$ against $t \cdot (n+1) \cdot \log_2(q)$ for a standard TFHE encryption, meaning a compression by a factor about $(n+1)$. 

This compressed TFHE encryption method can be applied directly to transmit homomorphically encrypted data from the user to the server. Alternatively, it can be combined with transciphering to encrypt a symmetric key. The resulting bandwidth requirements and the corresponding plaintext-to-ciphertext expansion factor are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:formulas_bandwidth}, where they are further compared with the naive (uncompressed) TFHE encryption. In particular, for \coolName, a wrapped key is of size $\lambda + (|\mathcal K| + |\mathcal W|) \cdot \log_2(q)$, (which in our case gives 784 bytes) for a security of $\lambda = 128$ bits (target security of \coolName), the standard choice of $q= 2^{64}$ (which we use in our implementation) and $|\mathcal K| + |\mathcal W| = 96$ per the specification of \coolName (see Section~\ref{sec:description}). This fixed cost is hence very quickly amortized while the amount of data to encrypt grows.
Moreover, this approach can be applied to the server keys as well, which are actually encryptions of the secret key's bits. \ifeprint We took this optimization into account in our estimations of the server key sizes in Table \ref{tab:server_key_size}. 
\paragraph{Compressing further.}
In Appendix \ref{sec:truncature}, we introduce an additional tweak to compress a TFHE encryption further by truncating its noisy bits.

\begin{comment}
Even without considering the transciphering technique, there are obvious ways to decrease the volume of communication between the client and the server. The first idea is to generate all the masks $(a_1, .., a_n)$ of the ciphertexts from a 128-bits seed. So, instead of sending the $n$ elements of a LWE ciphertext, only the seed and the body $b$ can be sent, efficiently reducing the volume from $n \cdot \log_2(q)$ to $128 + \log_2(q)$.

\subsection{Transciphering vs. Data Representation}
\label{sec:data_representation}



Managing data representation is a common challenge when working with TFHE. Since this scheme is only efficient at very low precision, an abstraction layer is required to construct practical data types (e.g., 8-, 32-, or 64-bit integers) from smaller encrypted chunks. Common constructions include radix-based decompositions and Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) representations, leading to different efficiency trade-offs. Carry propagation in radix-based representations is notoriously slow due to the large number of required bootstrappings, while CRT representations impose constraints on feasible operations. These constructions have been studied in~\cite{JC:BBBCLOT23}. 

As a result, there is no universal representation that is optimal for all homomorphic operations. Thankfully, the representation of data in the transciphering algorithm can be chosen independently of that of the homomorphic application running on the server. If the representation in $\mathbb Z_p$ does not suit the application, the server can convert the ciphertexts to the desired representation before running the application. %Such a conversion can be either applied to the TFHE ciphertexts obtained by the server after transciphering, or directly on the keystream (in this case, the symmetric ciphertexts are encoded directly in the desired representation, and the encryption/decryption operation is performed in the corresponding space). In both cases, it simply requires a bootstrapping for each element of $\mathbb Z_p$. 
We stress that this additional step of conversion would be necessary for any transciphering algorithm, as the data format desired in output of transciphering is completely application-dependent.

	
As a concrete example, assume that the data to be encrypted (i.e., the input to the homomorphic computation) consists of elements from $\mathbb{Z}_{16}$. The overall transciphering process unfolds as follows. On the client side, the plaintext is first embedded from $\mathbb{Z}_{16}$ into $\mathbb{Z}_{17}$ before being encrypted using \coolName. On the server side, the keystream is homomorphically generated and then used to homomorphically decrypt the ciphertext. This results in a TFHE encryption of the original plaintext, now embedded in $\mathbb{Z}_{17}$, meaning that the plaintext space for the TFHE encryption is $\mathbb{Z}_{17}$. A programmable bootstrapping (PBS) operation is then applied to switch the plaintext space from $\mathbb{Z}_{17}$ back to $\mathbb{Z}_{16}$.

In terms of computation, this process adds one PBS per $\mathbb{Z}_{16}$-element of the original plaintext, in addition to the four PBS per element required for keystream generation with \coolName. Moreover, embedding $\mathbb{Z}_{16}$ into $\mathbb{Z}_{17}$ increases the size of the encrypted data by a factor of $1 + 1/16 = 1.0625$.

This approach can be generalized to address other plaintext representations. In particular, for larger chunks of bits, the bootstrapping operation would allow to merge several elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{16}$ (embedded into $\mathbb{Z}_{17}$) into one element of $\mathbb{Z}_{2^\ell}$ with $\ell > 4$. On the other hand, one may split an element of $\mathbb{Z}_{16}$ (or its $\mathbb{Z}_{17}$ embedding) into 4 elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ using a PBS with multiple look-up tables (``PBSmanyLUT'') as proposed in~\cite{AC:CLOT21}.

	\subsection{Detailed Homomorphic Implementations}
	\label{sec:detailed_implementation}
	
	In the following, we provide a more detailed way of how we implemented the homomorphic version of \coolName.
	
	\paragraph{Homomorphic evaluation of LFSRs.}
	The \coolName design involves two LFSRs operating on elements of $\F_{17}$. The standard way to implement an LFSR is to evaluate the linear feedback function on the state at each clock cycle, thus producing a new element that enters the state, while the state is shifted to output an element. 
	%generate the new element at each clock cycle, and then to mutate the state by shifting the elements of the state and compute the linear combination of the state with the coefficients of retroaction to produce a new one.
	We suggest the \emph{silent LFSR} approach for the homomorphic evaluation of LFSRs. In this approach, the encrypted LFSR state is immutable to avoid any noise growth in the underlying ciphertexts (hence keeping the LFSR ``silent''). We use the fact that every output element of the LFSR can be expressed as a linear combination of the initial state. So, at each clock cycle, we compute \emph{in the clear} the coefficients of this linear combination and homomorphically evaluate it on the immutable encrypted state. This process is depicted in Algorithm~\ref{alg:lsfr}.
	
	\TODO{Algorithme du LSFR Ã  harmoniser (commentÃ© lÃ )}
%	\input{algorithms/silent_lsfr.tex}
	
	%Calling Algorithm \ref{alg:lsfr} (\texttt{LFSR.clock}) several times yields an encrypted stream of pseudorandom elements $(o^{(0)}, o^{(1)}, \dots)$.
	
	\paragraph{Homomorphic evaluation of} \coolName. The complete homomorphic evaluation of a round of on clock cycle of \coolName is depicted in Algorithm~\ref{alg:transistor}, using $\pseudoKS.\texttt{clock}$ and $\whitening.\texttt{clock}$ as subroutines (i.e., Algorithm~\ref{alg:lsfr} evaluated on the key schedule and whitening LFSRs). The most computation intensive part of the algorithm is by far the evaluation of the PBS in $\subWords$ which can be fully parallelized to reduce the latency.

\subsection{TFHE Parameters} 
\label{sec:tfhe-parameters}

\ifeprint
\else
	The details of the homomorphic implementation of \coolName{} are given in the full version~\cite{EPRINT:BBBBCL25}. In short, the LFSRs are clocked in a silent way (see Section \ref{sec:rationale-controllin-noise}), and the implementation of the rest of the algorithm is straightforward using the basics operations provided by the TFHE scheme (see Section~\ref{sec:preliminaries}). 
\fi

We discuss hereafter the selection of the different TFHE parameters involved in the homomorphic implementation of \coolName. Here is the list of the different parameters to be considered:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $q$: the modulo used for the ciphertexts,
	\item $n_{\text{short}}$: the dimension of the LWE ciphertexts used within the PBS algorithm,
	\item $k$: the dimension of GLWE ciphertexts,
	\item $N$: the degree of the polynomials in GLWE ciphertexts,
	\item $n_{\text{long}} = k \cdot N$: the dimension of the LWE ciphertexts extracted from GLWE ciphertexts,
	\item $\sigma_{\text{short}}, \sigma_{\text{long}}$: the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution of fresh noise in the ciphertexts of dimension respectively $n_{\text{short}}$ and  $n_{\text{long}}$,
	\item $B_{KS}$ and $B_{BR}$: the bases used in the gadget decompositions occurring in respectively the \textsf{Keyswitching} and the \textsf{BlindRotate} phases,
	\item $\ell_{KS}$ and $\ell_{BR}$: the levels of those decompositions.
\end{itemize}

Throughout the homomorphic evaluation of \coolName, the manipulated ciphertexts can be of three different types: LWE ciphertexts of dimension $n_{\text{short}}$, LWE ciphertexts of dimension $n_{\text{long}}$, or GLWE ciphertexts of dimension $k$ and polynomial degree $N$. \ifeprint{

}
\else %{Appendix~\ref{sec:schema_structure_fhe} shows the ciphertext format at the different steps of the homomorphic evaluation.

\fi

\paragraph{Optimization of the TFHE parameters.}
To generate a set of parameters, we use the method developed in~\cite{JC:BBBCLOT23}. Given the negligible noise contribution from the LFSRs, the FSM can be modeled using the \emph{atomic pattern} introduced in~\cite{JC:BBBCLOT23} (specifically the instance referred to as $\mathcal{A}^{(\text{CJP21})}$), which is a pattern of homomorphic operators taking a set of ciphertexts in input, computing linear combinations of those ciphertexts and applying a programmable bootstrapping to each of them. The FSM round in \coolName which composes a multiplication by a constant matrix ($\mixColumns$), followed by a bootstrapping step ($\subWords$) is precisely an instance of such an atomic pattern. The framework proposed in~\cite{JC:BBBCLOT23} generates parameters that guarantee a specified security level $\lambda$ for the LWE encryption and target error probability $p_{\text{err}}$, while optimizing the PBS to be as fast as possible. 
\ifeprint{
		Table \ref{tab:parameters} shows the parameters used for our experiments, all ensuring 128 bits of security. The obtained security levels $\lambda_{\text{short}}$ et $\lambda_{\text{long}}$ have been estimated using the \texttt{lattice estimator}~\cite{lattice-estimator}.

\fi


\paragraph{Encryption security.} 
The security level (in bits) of the LWE ciphertexts is a function of the modulus $q$, the dimension $n$ and the noise standard deviation $\sigma$. While no explicit formula exists for this function, the \emph{lattice estimator} tool allows to produce an estimation of this function by simulating the main attacks of the literature~\cite{lattice-estimator}, which we denote $\mathcal{O}$ (for \emph{security oracle}). The selected TFHE parameters are constrained to satisfy $\mathcal{O}(q,n,\sigma) \geq \lambda$ for both $(q,n,\sigma) = (q,n_{\text{short}},\sigma_{\text{short}})$ and $(q,n,\sigma) = (q,n_{\text{long}},\sigma_{\text{long}})$.



\paragraph{Correctness of the PBS.} To compute the error probability $p_{\text{err}}$, we have to evaluate the variances occurring inside the programmable bootstrapping of the $\subWords$ layer\ifeprint. We provide such an analysis in Appendix \ref{sec:pbs_variance_analysis}. \else (see full version~\cite{EPRINT:BBBBCL25}).\fi
In the following, we denote the maximum error probability of the bootstrapping by $p_{\text{err}} := 2^{-\kappa}$. We aim to choose parameters such that the PBS outputs a correct ciphertext with probability at least $1-p_{\text{err}}$. This translates to the following constraint:
$$\sigma^2_{\text{in-}\textsf{BR}} \leq  C(\kappa) \cdot \left(\frac1{4p}\right)^2 ~~~\text{with}~~~C(\kappa) := \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \mathsf{erfc}^{-1}(2^{-\kappa})}\right)^2 ~.$$
Under the Gaussian assumption, the noise in input of the \textsf{BlindRotate} is lower than $\mathsf{erfc}^{-1}(2^{-\kappa}) \cdot \sqrt{\sigma^2_{\text{in-}\textsf{BR}}}$ with probability $1-2^{-\kappa}$. The above constraint thus implies that, with probability $1-2^{-\kappa}$, the noise is lower than $1/{4p}$ which ensures the correctness of the PBS. 

As $|\mathcal W| \leq |\mathcal K|$, we can check that we always have $\sigma^2_{\text{out}} \leq \sigma^2_{\text{in-}\textsf{PBS}}$ which implies that the output is always bootstrappable with correctness probability at least $1-p_{\text{err}}$ in the subsequent bootstrapping.


\subsection{Performances} \label{sec:performances}

We provide hereafter some benchmarks of our implementation of \coolName for two sets of parameters tailored for two different error probabilities. We first consider $p_{\text{err}} = 2^{-40}$, which is a common choice in the literature to benchmark homomorphic implementations. Our results for this error probability allow a fair comparison with the state of the art. While such an error probability theoretically allows transciphering to be error-free with a large amount of data with good probability, some recent works have shown that non-negligible error probabilities could be exploited by an adversary in some contexts~\cite{EPRINT:CSBB24,EPRINT:CCPSS24}. Thus, we also provide another set of parameters and associated benchmark for $p_{\text{err}} =  2^{-128}$.

Our implementation relies on a customized version of \texttt{tfhe-rs}~\cite{TFHE-rs} which has been adapted to support odd $p$ (size of the plaintext space) as described in~\cite{BPR24}. The experiments were carried on a processor 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1245U with 4.4 GHz. Table \ref{tab:perfs} summarizes the obtained timings for the two sets of parameters. The throughput is computed assuming that $\log_2(17)$ bits are encoded on one element of $\F_{17}$. Encoding 4 bits on each element would scale the throughput by a factor $4/\log_2(17) \approx 0.98$.

\begin{table}[t!]
	\centering
		\caption{Performances of our two instances of \coolName.}

	\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}  % Adjust row spacing
	\begin{tabular}{|c||*{3}{>{\centering\arraybackslash}p{3cm}|}}
		\hline
		~~$p_{\text{err}}$~~ & Time for one PBS & Latency (one round) & Throughput\\
		\hline
		$2^{-40}$ & 11.9 ms & 195 ms & 83.84 bits/s\\
		\hline
		$2^{-128}$ & 15.28 ms & 251 ms & 65.10 bits/s\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}

\end{table}



Although our current implementation does not leverage the inherent parallelism of \coolName, it is important to note that it can be easily parallelized across 16 threads. Specifically, during the $\subWords$ steps, which dominate the overall runtime, the 16 PBS operations can be executed concurrently. This parallelization would result in nearly a 16-fold reduction in total execution time.

Without taking into account the server key\ifeprint(whose sizes are shown in Table \ref{tab:server_key_size})\fi, and using compressed encryption (Section \ref{sec:key_wrapping}),  transciphering 1 KB of plain data requires 1.78 KB of data to be sent, instead of 64 KB. For larger amounts of message, the volume of the encrypted symmetric key becomes negligible with respect to the message: for 1 MB of plain data, we use 1.0008 MB, and for 1 GB, this goes down to 1.000001 GB. The two sets of parameters yield the same bandwidth consumption, but not the same running time as shown in Table \ref{tab:perfs}.


 
\ifeprint{
    By applying the ``free truncation optimization" introduced in Appendix \ref{sec:truncature}, we can reduce the volume of the encrypted symmetric key by a factor~0.7. This is particularly useful when transciphering a small volume of data (the volume of the encrypted key being preponderant). For example, to transcipher 1 KB of data, using this technique decreases the volume from 1.78~KB to 1.54~KB. 
    
    in Table \ref{tab:server_key_size} we provide the sizes for the server keys, namely the \emph{key-switching key} (KSK) and the \emph{bootstrapping key} (BSK) while using the ciphertext compression technique described in Section~\ref{sec:key_wrapping}. Those keys are only generated and communicated to the server once (during some user enrollment step).

\subsection{Comparisons to the State of the Art}
\label{sec:perfs_soa}	

\subsubsection{Comparisons with other TFHE-friendly ciphers.} 
%In Section \ref{sec:soa}, we provided an overview of the recent landscape of TFHE-friendly symmetric ciphers.
In what follows, we compare \coolName with several of the most competitive state-of-the-art schemes. Our results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:comparisons_soa}.
Although such comparisons must be interpreted with care â due to differences in libraries, hardware platforms, and bootstrapping error probabilities â they still offer valuable insights into the relative efficiency and trade-offs of these approaches.


In~\cite{DBLP:conf/wahc/BalenboisOS23}, \texttt{Trivium} and \texttt{Kreyvium} were evaluated on a powerful AWS instance, which makes direct comparison with our local experiments impractical. However, an important distinction is that \coolName requires no setup phase, unlike these ciphers. Also, the implementation optimizes the running time by switching between two sets of parameters, doubling the size of the evaluation keys.

\texttt{Margrethe}~\cite{cryptoeprint:2024/1702} has low noise ratios ($2^{-15.3}$ or $2^{-21.9}$), compared to around $2^{-12}$ for \texttt{Transistor}. Its authors also report low latencies of 27 or 54 ms, and high throughputs of 147 or 73 bits/s (depending on the configuration). However, these come at the cost of much larger sizes for the encryptions of the symmetric key. Indeed, the use of Vertical Packing mandates that symmetric keys be encrypted under GGSW form, resulting in hundreds of megabytes. Although an alternative (lifting from LWE to GGSW using circuit bootstrapping) could reduce the transmission size, it would significantly degrade performance. 

Similarly, Deo et al. proposed~\cite{EPRINT:DJLCB24} a pseudorandom function whose security relies on the hardness of the LWR problem~\cite{EC:BanPeiRos12}. It enables a stream cipherâlike transciphering scheme, where each pseudorandom element in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ (with $p=2^5$) is produced using a single bootstrapping. Their implementation reaches up to 881 bits/s on their hardware, surpassing \texttt{Transistor} in throughput. However, as with \texttt{Margrethe}, this efficiency comes at the cost of a significant increase in key size: their PRF requires 500 to 1000 elements encrypted in GGSW form, which is much larger than the 96 elements in LWE form for \coolName.


The authors of \texttt{FRAST}~\cite{FRAST} implemented it with \texttt{tfhe-rs}, like \coolName. It targets 128-bit security with an error probability of $2^{-80}$. On the same platform, our instance of \coolName (with a tighter error bound of $2^{-128}$) achieves three times higher throughput, significantly lower latency, and does not require any setup phaseâunlike \texttt{FRAST}, which involves a 25-second setup. In addition, \texttt{FRAST} requires substantially larger evaluation key material, due to its use of multiple derivatives of the PBS algorithm. %Finally, no information is provided regarding the output noise level of the scheme.

However, this comes at the cost of larger sizes for the encryptions of the symmetric key: the use of Vertical Packing mandates that symmetric keys be encrypted under GGSW form, resulting in hundreds of megabytes. Although an alternative (lifting from LWE to GGSW using circuit bootstrapping) could reduce the transmission size, it would significantly degrade performance. On a positive note, their scheme shows favorable output noise ratios ($2^{-15.3}$ or $2^{-21.9}$), compared to around $2^{-12}$ for \texttt{Transistor}.

% \item \textbf{PRF-based construction}~\cite{EPRINT:DJLCB24}: This work proposes a pseudorandom function whose security relies on the hardness of the LWR problem~\cite{EC:BanPeiRos12}. It enables a stream cipherâlike transciphering scheme, where each pseudorandom element in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ (with $p=2^5$) is produced using a single bootstrapping. Their implementation reaches up to 881 bits/s on their hardware, surpassing \texttt{Transistor} in throughput. However, this efficiency comes with a trade-off in key size: their PRF requires 500 to 1000 elements encrypted in GGSW form (as with \texttt{Margrethe}), which is much larger than the 96 elements in LWE form for \coolName.


% \item \textbf{\texttt{FRAST}}~\cite{FRAST}: Implemented with \texttt{tfhe-rs}, just like \coolName, this scheme targets 128-bit security with an error probability of $2^{-80}$. On the same platform, our instance of \coolName (with a tighter error bound of $2^{-128}$) achieves three times higher throughput, significantly lower latency, and does not require any setup phaseâunlike \texttt{FRAST}, which involves a 25-second setup. In addition, \texttt{FRAST} requires substantially larger evaluation key material, due to its use of multiple derivatives of the PBS algorithm. Finally, no information is provided regarding the output noise level of the scheme.

\subsubsection{Comparisons with other homomorphic schemes.} 
TFHE yields very different trade-offs between the various performance metrics (latency, throughput, bandwith consumption, ...), compared to other FHE schemes. In scenarios where throughput is a priority, TFHEâand by extension, \texttt{Transistor}âis generally not the most suitable choice. However, TFHE shines in use cases that require low-latency homomorphic computations and efficient evaluation of look-up tables (LUTs), thanks to its native support for fast programmable bootstrapping.
In the following, we provide a brief survey of some transciphering approaches built upon alternative homomorphic encryption schemes.

For CKKS-based transciphering, we look at the AES evaluation using the so-called \texttt{XBOOT} optimization proposed in~\cite{cryptoeprint:2025/074}. While the reported amortized throughput significantly outperforms that of \coolName, it comes at the cost of a much higher latencyâ153s and 236s using 64 threads, compared to 251ms for \coolName running on a single thread. We observe similar results for  BGV-based transciphering. In this case we instead consider the optimized evaluation of \texttt{RASTA}~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/DobraunigE0LLLM18} presented in~\cite{cryptoeprint:2025/074}. Using the same \texttt{XBOOT} optimization as the CKKS variant, it also yields high latencies: 303s, again with 64-thread parallelism. 
%derivatives, which have the same issue. In \cite{cryptoeprint:2025/074}, the same optimization is applied, and the evaluation of RASTA incurs a latency of 303s, again using 64-thread parallelism. 

Lastly, \texttt{FINAL}~\cite{AC:BIPPS22} is another, more recent homomorphic encryption scheme based on NTRU. Its bootstrapping is approximately 30\% faster than TFHEâs, but it is not programmable, and therefore does not support LUT evaluation. The works~\cite{CiC:MeaParPer24,CCS:CDPP22} implement the stream cipher \texttt{Filip} using \texttt{FINAL}, relying on the Improved Filter Permutator paradigm, without LUTs' evaluation. The competitive performances of these implementations (resp. 159 bits/s and 381 bits/s) comes with a trade-off in key size: encrypting the symmetric key requires resp. 215 MB and 200 MB, versus 4.8 MB for \coolName~(uncompressed). This is mainly due to the size of the key register in \texttt{Filip} ($2^{14}$ bits), while \coolName~only requires the upload of 96 elements in~$\mathbb{Z}_{17}$ (around 400 bits).

%We can also mention FINAL \cite{AC:BIPPS22} which is a recent homomorphic scheme based on NTRU. Its bootstrapping is approximately 30\% faster than TFHEâs, but it is not programmable, and therefore does not support LUT evaluation. We can mention the work of \cite{CiC:MeaParPer24}, which implements the stream cipher \texttt{Filip} with FINAL. \texttt{Filip}'s design, based on the Improved Filter Permutator paradigm, does not rely on the evaluation of look-up tables. While the reported performance is highly competitive, it comes at the cost of a significantly larger symmetric key encryption: 215 MB for Filip, compared to 4.8 MB for Transistor (without compression). This difference is primarily due to the size of the key register in Filip --$2^{14}$ bits-- whereas Transistor only requires the upload of 96 elements in $\mathbb{Z}_{17}$ ($\approx 400$ bits).
