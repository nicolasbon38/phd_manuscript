  abstractnote = {Symmetric ciphers purposed for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) have recently been proposed for two main reasons. First, minimizing the implementation (time and memory) overheads that are inherent to current FHE schemes. Second, improving the homomorphic capacity, i.e. the amount of operations that one can perform on homomorphic ciphertexts before bootstrapping, which amounts to limit their level of noise. Existing solutions for this purpose suggest a gap between block ciphers and stream ciphers. The ﬁrst ones typically allow a constant but small homomorphic capacity, due to the iteration of rounds eventually leading to complex Boolean functions (hence large noise). The second ones typically allow a larger homomorphic capacity for the ﬁrst ciphertext blocks, that decreases with the number of ciphertext blocks (due to the increasing Boolean complexity of the stream ciphers’ output). In this paper, we aim to combine the best of these two worlds, and propose a new stream cipher construction that allows constant and small(er) noise. Its main idea is to apply a Boolean (ﬁlter) function to a public bit permutation of a constant key register, so that the Boolean complexity of the stream cipher outputs is constant. We also propose an instantiation of the ﬁlter function designed to exploit recent (3rd-generation) FHE schemes, where the error growth is quasi-additive when adequately multiplying ciphertexts with the same amount of noise. In order to stimulate further investigation, we then specify a few instances of this stream cipher, for which we provide a preliminary security analysis. We ﬁnally highlight the good properties of our stream cipher regarding the other goal of minimizing the time and memory complexity of calculus delegation (for 2nd-generation FHE schemes). We conclude the paper with open problems related to the large design space opened by these new constructions.},

  abstractnote = {The FHEW cryptosystem introduced the idea that an arbitrary function can be evaluated within the bootstrap procedure as a table lookup. The faster bootstraps of TFHE strengthened this approach, which was later named Functional Bootstrap (Boura et al., CSCML’19). From then on, little effort has been made towards defining efficient ways of using it to implement functions with high precision. In this paper, we introduce two methods to combine multiple functional bootstraps to accelerate the evaluation of reasonably large look-up tables and highly precise functions. We thoroughly analyze and experimentally validate the error propagation in both methods, as well as in the functional bootstrap itself. We leverage the multi-value bootstrap of Carpov et al. (CT-RSA’19) to accelerate (single) lookup table evaluation, and we improve it by lowering the complexity of its error variance growth from quadratic to linear in the value of the output base. Compared to previous literature using TFHE’s functional bootstrap, our methods are up to 2.49 times faster than the lookup table evaluation of Carpov et al. (CT-RSA’19) and up to 3.19 times faster than the 32-bit integer comparison of Bourse et al. (CT-RSA’20). Compared to works using logic gates, we achieved speedups of up to 6.98, 8.74, and 3.55 times over 8-bit implementations of the functions ReLU, Addition, and Maximum, respectively.},

Among them, TFHE [CGGI17] has the great advantage of oﬀering an eﬃcient method for bootstrapping noisy ciphertexts, i.e., reduce the noise. Indeed, homomorphic computation increases the noise in ciphertexts and might compromise the encrypted message. TFHE bootstrapping, in addition to reducing the noise, also evaluates (for free) univariate functions expressed as look-up tables. It however requires to have the most signiﬁcant bit of the plaintext to be known a priori, resulting in the loss of one bit of space to store messages. Furthermore it represents a non negligible overhead in terms of computation in many use cases.},

  abstractnote = {Computation on ciphertexts of all known fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes induces some noise, which, if too large, will destroy the plaintext. Therefore, the bootstrapping technique that re-encrypts a ciphertext and reduces the noise level remains the only known way of building FHE schemes for arbitrary unbounded computations. The bootstrapping step is also the major efficiency bottleneck in current FHE schemes. A promising direction towards improving concrete efficiency is to exploit the bootstrapping process to perform useful computation while reducing the noise at the same time. We show a bootstrapping algorithm, which embeds a lookup table and evaluates arbitrary functions of the plaintext while reducing the noise. Depending on the choice of parameters, the resulting homomorphic encryption scheme may be either an exact FHE or homomorphic encryption for approximate arithmetic. Since we can evaluate arbitrary functions over the plaintext space, we can use the natural homomorphism of Regev encryption to compute affine functions without bootstrapping almost for free. Consequently, our algorithms are particularly suitable for arithmetic circuits over a finite field with many additions and scalar multiplication gates. We achieve significant speedups when compared to binary circuit-based FHE. For example, we achieve 280-1200x speedups when computing an affine function of size 784 followed by any univariate function when compared to FHE schemes that compute binary circuits. With our bootstrapping algorithm, we can efficiently convert between arithmetic and boolean plaintexts and extend the plaintext space using the Chinese remainder theorem. Furthermore, we can run the computation in an exact and approximate mode where we trade-off the size of the plaintext space with approximation error. We provide a tight error analysis and show several parameter sets for our bootstrapping. Finally, we implement our algorithm and provide extensive tests. We demonstrate our algorithms by evaluating different neural networks in several parameter and accuracy settings.},
