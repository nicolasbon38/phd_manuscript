\chapter[The Negacyclicity Problem]{Overcoming the Negacyclicity Problem with an Odd Plaintext Modulus}
\label{chap:negacyclicity}


In Section \ref{sec:pbs}, we presented the algorithm of the \gls{PBS}. But we left a question unanswered: what is the actual composition of the accumulator polynomial $\acc$? This is a tricky question, because this definition depends on the countermeasure picked against the negacyclicity problem (that we briefly introduced in Section \ref{sec:overview_blind_rotation}). 


In this chapter, we formalize the negacyclicity problem. We then present the classical countermeasure (the strategy of the padding bit), and our technique of odd plaintext modulus, which is a foundational block for the following contributions presented in this thesis. We finish by going through several others works that propose different countermeasures.


\section{Basics on Negacyclicity}

\paragraph{What is negacyclicity ?}

Let $v(X)$ be a polynomial of the ring $\glweRing$, such that $v(X) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} v_k X^k$. Recall how a multiplication by $X$  in this ring ``rotates'' the coefficients of the polynomial: \[X \cdot v(X) = - v_{N - 1} + v_0 \cdot X \dots + v_{N - 2} X^{N - 1}~.\]

In \gls{TFHE}'s blind rotation, the polynomial multiplication is done by the monomial $X^{-\Tilde{\mu}}$, with $\Tilde{\mu} \in \left \lbrace 0, \dots, 2N - 1 \right \rbrace$. This leads to two problems:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A coefficient $v_j$ can be brought in first place by two different rotations: the one induced by the polynomial multiplication by $X^{\modulo{-j}{2N}}$ and the one by $X^{[-j + N]_{2N}}$. It means that two different messages produce the same output.
	\item Each time a coefficient goes last to first, it gets negated (because $X^N = -1$ in the ring). So actually, the multiplication by $X^{[-j]_{2N}}$ yields correctly $v_j$, but the one by $X^{[-j + N]_{2N}}$ yields $-v_j$.
\end{itemize}


As the actual value of $\tilde{\mu}$ is encrypted, this is not possible to predict beforehand whether this undesirable minus sign will appear or not. So a countermeasure needs to be implemented into the scheme to neutralize the negacyclicity problem. The most frequent strategy is to develop encodings for the \gls{LUT} $f$ in the accumulator specifically tailored to handle this issue.


\paragraph{The ``natural'' case.}

Some functions interact naturally very well with the blind rotation algorithm: these are called the \textit{negacyclic functions} and they are presented in Definition \ref{def:negacyclic_function}.


\begin{definition} (Negacyclic Function)
	Let $p$ and $p'$ be two positive integers, with $p$ even. A function $f : \Z_p \mapsto \Z_{p'}$ is negacyclic if and only if it satisfies the following property:
	
	\[
		\forall x \in \Z_p, f\left (\modulo{x + \frac p 2}{p} \right ) = \modulo{-f(x)}{p'}
	\]
	
	\label{def:negacyclic_function}
\end{definition}


With such functions, the accumulator is quite simple to build: intuitively we only fill it with the values of the first half of the torus (so the $f(x)$ with $x \in \left [0, \frac p 2 - 1 \right ]$). So, if we rotate by the value corresponding to $i \ge \frac p 2$, a minus sign appears and we retrieve correctly $-f\left(i - \frac p 2 \right)$ .

We give an explicit formula for this accumulator in Definition \ref{def:negacyclic_accumulator}

\begin{definition} (Negacyclic Accumulator)
		\label{def:negacyclic_accumulator}
		Let $p$ and $p'$ be two positive integers, with $p$ \textbf{even}. Let $f:\Z_p \mapsto \Z_{p'}$ be a negacyclic function. Let $N$ be a power of two. Then, the accumulator $\acc$, defined by:
	
	\[
		\acc^{\textsf{negacyclic}} = X^{\frac{-2N}{2p}} \cdot \sum_{j=0}^{2N / p - 1} X^j \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{p/2 - 1} f(i) X^{i \frac{2N}{p}} \mod (X^N + 1)
	\]
	
\noindent is a valid accumulator for the blind rotation. It means that running the $\BlindRotate$ algorithm with this accumulator yields the right value.
	
	\paragraph{Remark on the encoding:}
	$f(i)$ is an element of the plaintext space $\Z_p$. In the context of this definition, we refer to its encoding into the ciphertext space $\Z_q$ (according to the procedure of Section \ref{sec:encryption}). That is to say, we actually put $\rounding{\frac{f(i) \cdot q}{p}}$ in the coefficients of the polynomial.
\end{definition}



Unfortunately, this construction is merely theoretical. Indeed, in practical setting, restricting the functions to be evaluated by \gls{PBS} only to negacyclic function greatly limits the capability of the scheme. In order to be able to evaluate \textit{any} function in the \gls{PBS}, more sophisticated techniques are required. We introduce the first example of such technique in the next section.


\section{The Classical Countermeasure: the Bit of Padding}
\label{sec:bit_of_padding}

The first countermeasure, that already appeared in the original \gls{TFHE} paper, is called the \textit{bit of padding}. As in the ideal case presented in the previous section, it works in an \textbf{even} plaintext space.

The idea is to ensure that the message stays in the first half of the torus all along the computations. An equivalent way of presenting it is to force the \gls{MSB} of the message to zero. By doing this, the modswitched phase used as the exponent in the blind rotation $\tilde{\mu}$ lives in $\{0, \dots, N - 1\}$, so the arising minus signs never reach the degree-zero coefficient.

The advantage of this method is that it relaxes the negacyclicity constraint and makes the bootstrapping able to evaluate any function (not only the negacyclic one). However, this construction is rather fragile: any linear function can break it by propagating a carry into the \gls{MSB}. 

To avoid this, when evaluating an homomorphic circuit, the program needs to keep track of the maximal value that each homomorphic operation can yield and make sure that it will never propagate a carry into the \gls{MSB}. This often leads to extra bootstrapping to control the growth of the message and eliminate the overflows. 


In the following, we give the definition of the accumulator $\acc$ in this ``bit-of-padding'' case:

\begin{definition}(Bit-of-Padding accumulator)
	Let $p$ and $p'$ be two positive integers, with $p$ \textbf{even}. Let $f: \Z_p \mapsto \Z_{p'}$ be a function. Let $N$ be a power of two. Then, the accumulator $acc(X)$:
	\[
		\acc^{\textsf{bit-of-padding}} = X^{\frac{-N}{2p}} \cdot \sum_{j=0}^{N / p - 1} X^j \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{p - 1} f(i) X^{i \frac{N}{p}} \mod (X^N + 1)
	\]
	
\noindent is a valid accumulator for the blind rotation.
	\paragraph{Remark on the encoding:}
	Contrary to the purely negacyclic case of Definition \ref{def:negacyclic_accumulator}, $f(i)$ is not encoded in the Most Significant Bits of the polynomial's coefficient. Instead, the \gls{MSB} is reserved and fixed to zero to maintain the encoded value in the first half of the torus. That is to say, we actually put $\rounding{\frac{f(i) \cdot q}{2 \cdot p}}$ in the coefficients of the polynomial.
\end{definition}


An example of such an accumulator is shown on Figure \ref{fig:negacyclic_accumulator}.

	\label{fig:negacyclic_accumulator}
\end{figure}





The drawback of the bit-of-padding padding makes very challenging the development of homomorphic applications, because it prevents to use the linear operations freely. One should keep track of the maximal value contained in a ciphertext to avoid an overflow that would fill the padding bit. In Chapter \ref{chap:p_encodings}, we will demonstrate how this method makes the evaluation of Boolean circuit very inefficient, and we propose a new method that improves it.

Other constructions have been developed to avoid these drawbacks, we present them in Section \ref{sec:soa_padding_bit}.



\section{Other Countermeasures Avoiding the Bit of Padding}
\label{sec:soa_padding_bit}

Because the classical bit-of-padding solution brings too many constraints on the evaluation of computational circuits, several alternative constructions have been proposed to homomorphiclaly evaluate \gls{LUT}. To do so, many of these constructions adopt a similar strategy: they decompose the target function into a sequence of several \gls{PBS} steps. 

A notable line of work, including \cite{EPRINT:YXSCZ21}, \cite{AC:LiuMicPol22}, and \cite{TCHES:KluSch23}, employs a two-step \gls{PBS} strategy. In these approaches, the first \gls{PBS} evaluates a quantity  encrypting the bit indicating whether the message lies in the positive or negative half of the torus. This effectively extracts the ``sign'' of the message. The second \gls{PBS} then evaluates the actual function of interest regardless of the effects of negacyclicity, producing a result that may be flipped in sign. The ambiguity introduced by this flip is corrected using the result of the first \gls{PBS}. While the specific techniques used to perform this correction vary across works, the overall architecture remains the same: use the first \gls{PBS} to identify the torus half, and use this information to rectify the sign of the second \gls{PBS} output.

Another interesting approach is presented in \cite{AFRICACRYPT:CBSZ23}, where the target function is expressed as a sum of functions sharing a particular structure: so-called \textit{pseudo-odd} and a \textit{pseudo-even} function. These two properties are special cases of negacyclic functions, so they allow an evaluation with a \gls{PBS} without suffering from the negacyclicity issue. Although this decomposition may require more than two \gls{PBS} calls, an important advantage of the method is that the evaluations can be carried out in parallel. This contrasts with the previously mentioned approaches, which are intrinsically sequential due to the dependency between the two \gls{PBS} stages.

A completely different line of work is explored in \cite{AC:CLOT21}, which introduces the “Without-Padding \gls{PBS}” (\gls{WoP-PBS}) construction. A more refined version of this technique is presented in \cite{JC:BBBCLO23}, and we describe it here. The method begins by evaluating a scaled sign function (that is inherently negacyclic) using a standard \gls{PBS}. Following this, the individual bits of the message are extracted and converted into $\GGSW$ ciphertexts (see Definitions \ref{def:ggsw} and \ref{def:ggsw2}) using a procedure known as \textit{circuit bootstrapping}. These ciphertexts are then used as selectors in a graph of $\CMUX$ operations (Definition \ref{def:cmux}) to select an appropriate accumulator based on the high-order bits of the message. Finally, a traditional \gls{PBS} is used to rotate the selected accumulator according to the remaining lower-order bits.

Although this technique is slower for small plaintext sizes, it scales particularly well with an increasing plaintext sizes. Notably, it enables the homomorphic evaluation of LUTs with larger plaintext sizes beyond what is feasible with classical \gls{PBS} techniques, up to approximately 20 input bits.


In this thesis, we focus on a method we introduced in \cite{TCHES:BonPoiRiv24}: \textit{the odd plaintext modulus}.

\section{Base of Our Contributions: the Odd Plaintext Modulus}
\label{sec:odd_modulus}

Negacyclicity has a quite different effect depending of the parity of the plaintext modulus $p$. Recall that $\mu = m + e \in \Z_q$, with $e$ sampled from a small centered Gaussian. Because the error is small, $\mu$ does not take all the values of $\Z_q$ with the same probability: in particular, the densest parts in terms of probability over $\Z_q$ are the one close to the ``noiseless'' encodings of $m$, namely $\left \{ \rounding{\frac {k q}{p}} ~\middle |~ k \in \Z_p \right \}$. We illustrate this distribution on Figure \ref{fig:density_of_phase}. We call these sections of the torus the \emph{dense spots}.


\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{minipage}{0.47\textwidth}

		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/to_harmonize/busy_sectors_2.png}

	\begin{minipage}{0.47\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/to_harmonize/busy_sectors.png}
	\end{minipage}
	\caption{Distribution of the values of $\mu$ across $\mathbb{Z}_q$ for $p = 6$ and $p = 5$: the colored parts show the dense spots where the value has a high probability to lie in. The width of these sectors depends on $\sigma$ (the standard deviation of the error distribution $\chi$ of \gls{TFHE}). Note that this repartition looks similar for $\Tilde{\mu}$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$.}
	\label{fig:density_of_phase}
\end{figure}


When we transpose these dense spots into $\Z_{2N}$, they become the sectors close to $\left \{ \rounding{\frac{k \cdot 2N}{p}} \mid k \in \Z_p \right \}$. 

Let $k \in \Z_p$, the multiplication $X^{- \frac{k \cdot 2N}{p}} \cdot v(X)$ in the ring $\glweRing$ yields the same degree-zero coefficient as the multiplication  $X^{\modulo{- \frac{k \cdot 2N}{p} + N}{2N}} \cdot v(X)$, up to the minus sign. To make the rest of this section clearer, we change a bit the writing of the exponent as such: 
\[\modulo{
	\frac{
		-k \cdot 2N
	}
	{
		p
	}
	+ N
}{2N} = 
\modulo{
	\frac{
		(-k + \frac p 2 ) \cdot 2N
	}
	{p}
}
{2N}\]


This is where the parity of $p$ plays a part: if $p$ is even, then $\modulo{
	\frac{
		(-k + \frac p 2 ) \cdot 2N
	}
	{p}
}
{2N}$ is a dense spot as well. So collisions happen with high probability.  On the other hand, let us consider an odd value for $p$. Then, $\modulo{
	\frac{
		(-k + \frac p 2 ) \cdot 2N
	}
	{p}
}{2N}$ is no longer a dense spot, as it lies exactly halfway between the two dense spots $\modulo{
	\frac{
		(-k + \frac {p-1} {2} ) \cdot 2N
	}
	{p}
}{2N}$ and $\modulo{
	\frac{
		(-k + \frac {p+1} {2} ) \cdot 2N
	}
	{p}
}{2N}$. As a consequence, collisions never occur. Figure \ref{fig:torus_p_even_vs_odd} illustrates this phenomenon.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{}
	\label{fig:torus_p_even_vs_odd}
\end{figure}



So, by selecting odd values for the plaintext modulus, the negacyclicity problem is naturally neutralized.


We present in Definition \ref{def:odd_accumulator} the formula for the accumulator in this case. Note that because $N$ is a power of two and $p$ an odd value, some rounding is required in the quotient $\frac N p$, but we omit it to keep notations lighter, (or equivalently, the division operator is assumed to include rounding).

\begin{definition}(Odd-case Accumulator)
	\label{def:odd_accumulator}
	Let $p$ and $p'$ be two integers, with $p$ \textbf{odd}. Let $f: \Z_p \mapsto \Z_{p'}$ a function, and $N$ a power of two. Then, the accumulator $\acc \in \glweRing$ has the form:
	\[
		\acc^{\textsf{odd-modulus}} = X^{- \frac {N} {2p}} \cdot \sum_{j=0}^{N/p - 1} X^j  \cdot \left ( \sum_{i=0}^{\frac{p-1}{2}} f(i) X^{i \frac{2N}{p}} + \sum_{i=0}^{\frac{p-1}{2} - 1} -f \left (i + \frac{p+1}{2} \right ) X^{i \frac{2N}{p} + \frac N p} \right )
	\]
	
	\paragraph{Remark on the encoding:}
	With this construction, we do not need a bit of padding anymore. So, the values $f(i)$ are encoded using the simple encoding of Section \ref{sec:encryption}, that is to say $\rounding{\frac{f(i) \cdot q}{p}}$.
\end{definition}



Let us explain the structure of this accumulator. The polynomial has degree $N$ and is made of $p$ distinct windows of width $\frac{N}{p}$. Each of these windows has constant coefficient value $f(k)$, for $k \in \{0, \dots, p-1\}$.
For $0 \le \alpha \le \frac{p-1}{2}$, the range of degrees whose coefficients are $f(\alpha)$ is $\left [ \alpha \frac{2N}{p} - \frac{N}{2p}~;~ \alpha \frac{2N}{p} + \frac{N}{2p} \right ]$. Now, for $\frac{p+1}{2} \le \beta \le p-1$, we can write $\beta = \alpha + \frac{p+1}{2}$, with $0 \le \alpha < \frac{p-1}{2}$. This time, the range of spanned degrees is $\left [ \alpha \frac{2N}{p} + \frac{N}{2p} ~;~ (\alpha + 1) \frac{2N}{p} - \frac{N}{2p} \right ]$. Thus, the values $k \in \{0, \dots, p-1\}$ spans the entire space $[0; N)$ without overlap. The values over $\frac{p+1}{2}$ gets negated by the negacyclicity, so the underlying coefficient is also negated to compensate this effect. We illustrate this construction on Figure \ref{fig:accumulator_odd}.

	\label{fig:accumulator_odd}
\end{figure}


If we compare this approach to the bit-of-padding one, the windows have half the size. So we may think that the bound on the maximal noise to ensure correctness must be twice tighter. However, because the bit-of-padding accumulator makes use of only one half of the torus, the windows actually have the same width if we consider the same size of plaintext space. In Section \ref{sec:parametrization}, we elaborate further on how the parametrization of the scheme is handled in this case.


With this technique, no bit of padding is required. Consequently, it allows to use the linear homomorphisms without worrying about carry propagation. This is a key improvement that is at the root of the works presented in the rest of this thesis.





\section{Conclusion}

The idea of employing odd plaintext moduli that we developed in Section \ref{sec:odd_modulus} do not have any computational overhead with respect to the classical bit-of-padding technique of Section \ref{sec:bit_of_padding}, while removing all the constraints the latter put on the homomorphic compilation. This is not the case of the other methods of the state of the art that we summed up in Section \ref{sec:soa_padding_bit}, which all increase the amount of computation 

However, working with an odd modulus may seem unhandy: data types in programming are usually defined on a power-of-two modulus for example. But we show in the following chapters (Chapter \ref{chap:p_encodings}, \ref{chap:hyppogriph}, \ref{chap:transistor} and \ref{chap:larger_lut}) that this introduces new applications and homomorphic capabilities to \gls{TFHE}.
