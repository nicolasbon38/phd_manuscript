\section{Conclusion}


In this chapter, we combined the strengths of both Boolean and arithmetic representations to develop a framework enabling homomorphic conversion between the two. This approach proved effective: we managed to construct the fastest homomorphic implementation of \gls{AES} currently available in the literature.

Although the focus here is primarily on \gls{AES}, this work represents a first step toward resolving the common tension between Boolean and byte-level representations when executing algorithms over \gls{TFHE}. Beyond achieving “the fastest \gls{AES}-over-\gls{TFHE},” our method could also be used for implementing other block ciphers of similar SPN (for \textit{Substitution-Permutation Network}) structures in transciphering applications.

Transciphering is the central theme of the next chapter. While block ciphers were the focus here, the following chapter shifts attention to stream ciphers as alternative solutions.
